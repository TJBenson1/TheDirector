 * Reality-default contracts (see docs/DESIGN-reality-default.md).

 * against a fixed contract rather than inventing an incompatible one.
 *
 * Principle 1: AI clubs execute their REAL transfers by default; autonomous
 * decision-making fires only when a ledger entry is invalidated, and every
 * butterfly is a traceable chain logged to `timeline.divergenceLog`.
 *
 * Principle 2: academy intakes and scoutable prospects are REAL players only;
 * procedural players (`curated === false`) are anonymous depth, excluded from
 * scouting, academy and narrative.
